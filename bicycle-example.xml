	<text>THE WORLD ON WHEELS
The Improvements Made The
Lehi Exhibition
The annual London Stanley show of
bicycles tricycles quadricycles etc
established by the Stanley club about
twelve years ago came off the latter
end of January this year in the
Crystal Palace Sydenham There were
nearly 200 exhibitors who had about
1000 machines besides accessories on
exhibition The show was attended by
79 365 persons and is considered the
greatest trade show in Great Britain I
and in the world I
Among the main features manifested
in the sbow were the following
FirstImprovements in details finish
and enameling rather than in new
types or novelties generally Much
nickelplating is not fashionable over
there
SecondThe ordinary large wheel
crank machine is taking a back posi
tion being outrivaled by the Rover
type safety and its variation which
nave equal or nearly equal size wheels
which are usually but not invariably
about thirty inches in diameter also
by the rational ordinary which is a
modification of the common ordi
nary having rather smaller front
wheels larger rear wleels twenty to
twentyeight inches but mostly twenty
two or twentyfour inches plenty of
clearance or room between wheels and
frame and increased rake or backward
inclination of front fork these changes
tending toward safety from headers
ThirdPrevalence of double diamond
frames for the small wheel safeties
Fourth Disappearance of the Kan
garoos or dwarf ordinaries chain
geared
FifthLadies safety bicycles ex
hibited by most manufacturers al
though many of them doubted whether
those machines would become popular
with the ladies owing to the general
fear of what Mrs Grundy might say
about them
SixthMore ease and comfort in sad
dles and saddle springs
SeventhTandem bicycles for gentle
men orladies either or both
Eighth A few new things such as
the Budge Triplet a quadncle for the
riders on which the remarkable time of
a mile in 218 was recently made on the
public road also the Notmghani So
ciable a tricycle for two ritars abeast
gentleman and lady may be one on in
front of each driving wheel the steering
wheel being smaller and centrals in
front
Two tons of the issue of the Cyclist
the leading British wheel paper a large
octavo weekly containing the report of
tbe show were sold The number con
tained 136 pages with di gram of the
show and was retailed at i penny or 2
cents Pretty good for a trade paper

	<text>ASTRIDE THE WHEEL
Another Plea in Behalf of the
Abused Wlicelinan
rUE EIDER AGAINST THE WALKER
To Busy BrainWorkers the Bicycle is a God
send The New Safeties Bicycling
No Longer Selfish Pleasure
ANENT THE letter of H Pembroke in las
Sundays HEICAIU there is much more I
might be said both as to the condition of
roads car tracks etc and also as to the
mutual forbearance of pedestrians wheel
men and teamsters The wheel has become
a great factor in social and business econ
omy as much so in its way as the tele
graph telephone sewingmachine reaper
etc It is of fully as much importance t &lt;
he or she who makes use of it as either of
the articles mentioned The nonwheel
manthe man who wastes his time in walk
ing or the confirmed dyspeptic may say
that man has walked for centuries and
walking is good enough Well so is hand
sewing and handreaping and letterwrit
ing and these good old ways of doing things
will last till doomsday no doubt But
while Mr Slowman is reaping by hand in
the good old style Mr Fastboy has his
harvist in and can put in a week or two of
I time which he has gained in some further
needed farm improvement or some neces
sary labor Mr Slowmans barn leaks
because he hasnt time to lix it He pos
tively has not the time because he has
wantonly wasted the time by his own
stupidity or his contempt for newfangled
thinsthe same things which Mr Nine
tcenthCenturyFastboy was quick to see
the utility of Mr Slowman walks or
spends half his time hitching up feeding
grooming or doctoring a horse and cart and
harness Fastboy has mounted his wheel
of steel and run his errand before Slow
man has started on his Slowman the
clerk walks home to dinner and feels used
up by the time he gets back to the store
Fastboy has an enjoyable ride plenty of
time to eat dinner and twenty minutes to
spare with his family which Slowman has
wasted in walking Fastboy feels refreshed
and better for his dinner outing ho
digests his food better he is better naturcd
to customers he is a better citizen than
Slowman Whoever knew a wheelman
that was not a good citizen and a jolly good
fellow
VeRILY THE twowheeler the bicycle
has become an institution of the earth
Not only in civilized but in all countries is
its value becoming known
There are over two millions in use
Hence it is here to stay
It is not a craze as roller skates were
It is not a folly or a toy
It is business I
It is a time saver a health giver a
pleasure and a convenience
Since the introduction of the ladys
bicycle it can no longer be called a selfish
pleasure
More wheels mean better roadsbetter
roads mean more pleasure for both pedes
trians and teamsters
The better the roads are kept the more
prosperous a community becomes The
League of American Wheelmen now num
bering 15000 are turning their attention to I
road making all over the land
They are already compelling road super
visors to do their duty in many places
They have a legal fund and the best legal
counsel The people get the benefit of this
warfare and may well exclaim Long live
the wheel I
Mu SLOW MIX says the wheel is danger
ous to ride
A friend of mine once asked me to ride
with him behind his trotter I declined
plsasantly as I patted my wheel and he
suggested that it was so much safer than a
bicycle Two days afterward that man
came around for some court plaster He
was a picture for a comic almanac good
representation of the breaking up of a hard
winter The horse had run away the
buggy could not stand the pressure and
the whole outfit was demoralized
Then I laughed I had him on the hip
A CUlEPlL rider on a safety bicycle need
never have a fall If he or she does tLo
foot is never more than six inches from the
ground
If you are a pedestrian and a bicycle
bears down upon you keep your own way
swerve not to the right nor the left You
have a right to your share of the road You
have a right to dance back and forth in
front of the wheelman but please dont
do itYouhaea
You have a right to stand on your head on
the street but please dont do it It makes
ho wheelman want to get off and kill you
with an ax or a large club with spikes in it
And he wonders how you escaped from the
lunatic asylum
He wants you to have your share of the
earth but hopes you wont take up a
wide irregular erratic track by dancing
back and forth in front of him
Go your way and unless there is four or
five of you abreast he wont touch you by
a yard or more
AND DOXT ask him to ring a bell It only
frightens you more and makes you mote
widely rattled than if he glides silently past
you before you realize he is near
Besides this you feel angry with him for
the tinkle or zrrr of that bell seems to
form the words get out of my way
And then you are as mad as a hornet and
you have a right to be The bell is a hum
bug > I have tried it under all condi
tions and never yet made any friends with
it The wheelman has more cause to fear
a collision than you have for he generally
takes the worst tumble Falls on his neck
as it were So pedestrian teamster wheel
man and woman bear and forbear with
each others peculiarities and you will find
that the world is wide enough for all
PEMBROKE HAS disposed of two Stars the
past week and has two of the safety Stars
on the read
To nosy brainworkers the bicycle is a
Godsend almost if not quite a necessity
Dr Blackham
G W QUSHING has one Columbia light
roadster safety now on the road It was
ordered for a gentleman of this city
A sios on a large crank bicycle set out for
sale on Main street reads For sale cheap
Vo want to ride the drop frame safety
BROWNING Bitos of Ogden have placed
an order for a new Volant safety built on
the Springfield roadster principle also a
ambler ladys bicycle
THE IHCTCLE simply converts a step into
a rotary motion and a more rapid move
mentof the feet is practicable in the latter
so that from eight to fifteen miles an hour
arc feasible on the road
OTIIC VICTOR and Columbia makers are
now dealing in ladys or dropframe bicycles
cycles having been compelled to import
hem from England to supply the growing
demand Every maker is fast working to
bring out one of domestic manufacture
Straws show which way the wind blows
CONTRAST THE man who limits his daily
physical exercise to the use of dumbbells
the crossbars and a stroll in the evening
with a man who takes his daily run on his
bicycle and you will find in the majority of
instances that the preponderance of health
and strength is largely on the side of the
latter
THE MANAGING editor of one of the big
dailies repeatedly said that the bicycle has
proved of very great use to his paper and
a reporter on the PostDispatch emphasized
the remark by saying Since I got a
wheel my work has become a source of
pleasure rather than a task tobe got through
with I get more done and do it much
quicker than ever before I dont see why
the wheel will not become indispensable to
n daily paper
